[ ] Implement DICOM check task - How to deal with errors? Put these errors in the error_message of the
    task which gets displayed when the task has failed. You can also display a message when the task
    succeeds, i.e., generates a new dataset containing the correct files.

[ ] Implement L3/TAG file matching task

[ ] Use Storage class for file storage instead of open('', 'w')

[ ] Create task classes in separate package and name them MyQuickTask.py

====

[X] Create task that generates output dataset

[X] Improve task handling

[X] Improve dataset creation using string file paths instead of FileField - This will allow you to
    create new datasets without uploading first. Tasks can then generate new datasets (e.g., filtered
    versions of the original)

[X] Allow renaming of datasets - Task output datasets are derived from an original dataset and named
    accordingly, e.g., my-dataset-<task name>-<timestamp>
