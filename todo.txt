[ ] Create task that generates output dataset

[X] Improve task handling

[X] Improve dataset creation using string file paths instead of FileField - This will allow you to
    create new datasets without uploading first. Tasks can then generate new datasets (e.g., filtered
    versions of the original)

[X] Allow renaming of datasets - Task output datasets are derived from an original dataset and named
    accordingly, e.g., my-dataset-<task name>-<timestamp>
