# webapp-template
Template project using NGINX, Django, Bootstrap and Docker

The purpose of this project is to create a default web application that can be reused 
many times by adding simple extensions. The base project should be adaptable without
the need to refactor the target project. So, if the target project requires additional
views, these should not impact the views.py file of the base project.
